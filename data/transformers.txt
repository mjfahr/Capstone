1.0 SCOPE\n\nThis data sheet contains loss prevention recommendations related to the fire protection of ALL types of transformers. It also contains loss prevention recommendations related to the electrical protection, electrical testing, maintenance, and operation of large, critical distribution, power, and specialty transformers ONLY. For loss prevention recommendations related to electrical protection, electrical testing, maintenance, and operation of smaller and less-critical transformers, see Data Sheet 5-20, Electrical Testing.\n\nSee Data Sheet 5-20 for distribution transformers smaller than about 5 MVA. These transformers step down the utility voltage for use in a commercial or industrial property. Such transformers can usually be replaced within several days.\n\nSpecialty transformers include network transformers, rectifier transformers, arc furnace transformers, induction furnace transformers, generator step-up transformers, series reactors, and shunt reactors.\ntag: DS5-4 S1.0

1.1 Changes\n\nJuly 2019.\n\nThis document has been completely revised. Major changes include the following:\n\nA. Updated differential protection recommendations for special transformers.\n\nB. Improved the clarity and consistency of guidance on transformer online condition monitoring sensor recommendations, and their integration into an overall condition-based maintenance approach.\n\nC. Improved contingency plan guidance.\n\nD. Added new CAF guidance for protection of indoor transformers.\n\nE. Revised content related to silicone insulating fluids.\n\nF. Revised guidance for PCB-contaminated transformers.\n\nG. Aligned B&M guidance with an asset integrity approach with some emphasis on recommendations on deficiency management.\ntag: DS5-4 S1.1

1.2 Hazards\n\nPower and distribution transformers are reliable devices with low failure rates. Adequate electrical protection, electrical testing, maintenance, and proper operation are key factors in reducing the risk of transformer explosions and fires.\n\nFM Globalâs loss statistics show that it is about 10 times more likely for a transformer to fail without a resulting explosion and fire. However, in some cases an internal fault may result in an overpressure of the transformer sufficient to cause tank rupture. Tank rupture will release substantial quantities of oil, with a resulting oil mist explosion and a long-burning, high heat release, oil pool fire. Fire protection and proper construction features are critical to limiting the extent of damage to adjacent structures and equipment in the event of a transformer fire.\ntag: DS5-4 S1.2

2.1.1.2 Provide overvoltage transient protection for all transformers in accordance with Data Sheet 5-11, Lightning and Surge Protection for Electrical Systems.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.1.2

2.1.1.3 Provide differential protection to cover all the windings on multiple-winding power transformers, including specialty transformers such as rectifier, induction, and arc furnace transformers when applicable. Where the high magnetic fields of specialty transformers prohibit the use of conventional iron core current transformers, use Rogowski coil current sensors to implement differential protection.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.1.3

2.1.1.4 Provide overcurrent and ground fault protection for the tertiary winding of three-winding transformers and autotransformers.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.1.4

2.1.1.5 Provide an arc-monitoring system to detect arcing faults in transformer vaults with exposed energized components. Provide this additional protection when the ground fault relay cannot be set low enough to detect ground fault current due to neutral imbalance current flow. Table 1 contains a list of specialty transformers and the additional protection recommended for them.\n\nTable 1. Recommended Additional Protection for Specialty Transformers\n\n| Transformer Type | Special Features | Additional Protection |\n| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |\n| In-phase regulating transformer | The high impedance exciting winding (or shunt winding) makes it difficult to detect faults in this winding with a high level of sensitivity. | Primary protection should consist of sudden pressure relays in the main tanks as well as the tap changer compartment. Differential protection for the exciting winding is also needed.Â¹ |\n| Phase-shifting, quadrature booster transformer | In addition to the issues with the high impedance exciting winding mentioned above for in-phase regulating transformers, protection of phase shifting transformers also needs to consider protection requirements for the shunt and series windings. | Primary protection should consist of sudden pressure relays in the main tanks (quadrature booster transformers usually have at least two sets of tanks to house the shunt and series transformers) as well as the tap changer compartment. Differential protection for the exciting, series, and shunt winding is also needed.Â² |\n| Load tap changing transformer | The tap winding and preventive auto transformer (if provided) will be part of the protection zone covered by the transformer protection. Therefore, dedicated protection for the tap changer is not needed. However, the tap changer needs to be taken into account when designing the protection for the transformer. For example, the tap position will affect transformer differential protection and needs to be accounted for. The separate tap changer compartment also needs to be protected from overpressure. And, protection should also be considered for the tap changer motor. | Separate Bucholz relays should be provided if the load tap changer compartment is supplied from a separate conservator tank or from a separate compartment of the conservator tank. Sudden pressure relays are also needed for the load tap changer compartment. Overload, short circuit, and ground fault protection should be provided for the load tap changer motor. |\n| Grounding transformer | A grounding transformer that is solidly or low resistance grounded is not able to withstand ground faults for long. When the grounding transformer is located within the differential protection zone of the main transformer, zero sequence current provided by the grounding transformer during external ground faults can cause a false differential protection trip. | Overcurrent relay protection arranged to pick up zero sequence current should be provided to protect the grounding transformer. Differential protection may also be used for this purpose. Sudden pressure relays are needed as a primary defense against internal faults, especially for zig-zag grounding transformers where the internal impedance can limit the current during internal turn-to-turn faults. A zero sequence filter should be included when the grounding transformer is in the protection zone to prevent inadvertent differential protection operation. |\n| Arc furnace transformer | The high magnetic fields, high secondary currents, and a large harmonic content in the secondary current makes it impractical to implement differential protection using conventional iron core current transformers. | Use Rogowski Coil current sensors to implement differential protection. |\n| Rectifier transformer | The same features present in arc furnace transformers, as well as the large physical size of the bushings of the double secondary windings of some rectifier transformers, make it impractical to implement differential protection using conventional iron core current transformers. | Use Rogowski Coil current sensors to implement differential protection. |\n\n1 The CTs for the exciting winding differential protection may need to be installed internally.\n\n2 The CTs to implement differential protection for these transformers are typically located internally and need to be specified during manufacture.\n\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.1.5 T1

2.1.2 Transportation of Transformers\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.2

2.1.2.1 Install multiple impact recorders on transformers whenever transformers need to be moved.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.2.1

2.1.2.2 Perform a frequency response analysis measurement of the transformer before it is moved. Repeat this measurement after the transformer has arrived at its destination to determine if any winding or core movement occurred.\n\nNote that FRA measurements will be affected if there is fluid in the transformer and/or bushings are installed.\n\nPerform the measurements with the transformer in the same state so the results can be compared.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.2.2

2.1.3 Operation and Maintenance\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3

2.1.3.1 Benchmark Testing\nBenchmark testing (or âfingerprintingâ) is a valuable method of providing baseline data about a transformer.\n\nThis information is used to make asset management decisions, to help with troubleshooting, and make decisions about whether to reenergize a transformer after it has tripped.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.1

2.1.3.1.1 Perform the following benchmark tests on all new transformers:\n\nâ¢ Thermography\n\nâ¢ Frequency Response Analysis\n\nâ¢ Exciting Current\n\nâ¢ Leakage Reactance\n\nâ¢ Partial Discharge Analysis\n\nâ¢ Acoustic Measurement of the On Load Tap Changer\n\nâ¢ Acoustic Measurement of the transformer tank\n\nâ¢ Power Factor Testing (windings and bushings)\n\nâ¢ Capacitance (windings and bushings)\n\nâ¢ Furan Analysis\n\nâ¢ Moisture in solid insulation\n\nâ¢ Corrosive sulfur in oil\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.1.1

2.1.3.1.2 Perform benchmark tests on existing critical in-service transformers if baseline data for these transformers has never beencollected.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.1.2

2.1.3.2 Testing and Maintenance\nThe recommended frequencies for inspection, testing, and maintenance are a general guide. These frequencies should be increased or decreased depending on factors such as the criticality of the unit, operating history, operating condition, availability of online monitoring, and age.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.2

2.1.3.2.1 Visually inspect transformers on a regular basis to check for problems such as cracked bushings, fouled radiators, low oil levels, low nitrogen pressure, expired desiccant, leaks, and other abnormal conditions. For indoor transformers, check that equipment is operating in a clean, cool, dry, and tight condition with no abnormal noises, smells, vibration, or heat. Also ensure housekeeping is satisfactory, with no dust, debris, temporary storage, or exposed combustible materials.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.2.1

2.1.3.2.2 Perform the following online tests once a year, and more frequently if warranted based on operating history, condition, and/or criticality for main tank and LTC oil compartment:\n\nA. Thermography\n\nB. Dissolved gas analysis\n\nC. Fluid screening\n\n1. For mineral oil, include the following tests at a minimum:\n\nâ¢ Color\n\nâ¢ Dielectric breakdown strength\n\nâ¢ Moisture\n\nâ¢ Power factor\n\nâ¢ Interfacial tension\n\nâ¢ Neutralization number\n\nâ¢ Inhibitor content (only for inhibited oils)\n\n2. For natural ester oil, include the following tests at a minimum:\n\nâ¢ Color\n\nâ¢ Dielectric breakdown strength\n\nâ¢ Moisture\n\nâ¢ Power factor\n\nâ¢ Fire point\n\nâ¢ Viscosity\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.2.2

2.1.3.2.3 Perform corrosive sulfur testing of transformers that were built or have had their oil processed or replaced in 2000 or later, and if the oil has not been tested for corrosive sulfur. In particular, perform corrosive sulfur testing of transformers that meet the following conditions:\n\nâ¢ The transformer fluid is a mineral oil.\n\nâ¢ The mineral oil is an uninhibited type.\n\nâ¢ The oil preservation system is sealed (not free breathing).\n\nâ¢ The transformer has a high sustained load factor.\n\nâ¢ The transformer is operating in a hot climate.\n\nâ¢ The transformer windings are bare copper.\n\nTransformers that meet these conditions are at the highest risk of failure due to corrosive sulfur contamination.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.2.3

2.1.3.2.3.1 Perform the IEC 62535 or Doble covered conductor deposition test in addition to the ASTM 1275 Modified Method B test.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.2.3.1

2.1.3.2.3.2 When corrosive sulfur is detected, add copper passivators to the transformer oil to a concentration of 100 ppm. Check the concentration of the passivators on an annual basis to determine if additional passivators are needed. Add additional passivators as needed. Note: The addition of passivators needs to be made known to the laboratory performing dissolved gas analysis, as passivators can affect the stray gassing characteristics of the transformer oil.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.3.2.3.2

2.1.4.3.1 Online condition monitoring systems are not a substitute for electrical testing. Online condition monitoring systems can be used to adjust the interval between electrical testing, but should not be used to justify a lack of testing. FM Global views online condition monitoring systems as broadband, early warning systems that trigger more focused electrical tests, including offline testing to confirm problems detected by the online condition monitoring system. An effective online condition monitoring system requires at least the following human elements:\n\nA. Pre-defined action plans for various alert setting levels that are agreed by stakeholders.\n\nB. Tracking of actions for response to alerts, including who responds to alerts, when, and with what comments.\n\nC. Clear ownership of the online condition monitoring systems with sufficient knowledge and experience level.

2.1.4.4 For transformers with a bladder in the conservator tank, check the bladder for leaks once every two years. This is done by swabbing the inside of the bladder to check for oil, and also checking the oil screen and DGA results for indications of bladder leaks. Replace leaking bladders as soon as possible.\n\nThe bladder in a conservator tank generally has a 10-year life. A leaking bladder will allow oxygen and moisture to enter the transformer, which accelerates its aging process. Proper maintenance of the bladder is a critical part of a transformer life management program.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.4.4

2.1.4.5 Test the electrical protection system (fuses, circuit breakers, batteries, surge arrestor, and electrical and mechanical relays such as sudden pressure relay) in accordance with Data Sheet 5-19, Switchgear and Circuit Breakers.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.4.5

2.1.5 Operation\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5

2.1.5.1 Install, operate, and maintain transformers in accordance with the manufacturersâ recommendations.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.1

2.1.5.2 Follow the manufacturerâs instructions for filling new transformers with oil. Check all oil to ensure it meets the specifications for new oil. In particular, make sure the moisture content, PCB content, and corrosive sulfur content are within limits.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.2

2.1.5.3 Immediately after commissioning, and periodically for several days after commissioning, inspect the transformer thoroughly for indications of overheating, oil leaks, abnormal vibration, abnormal noise, and malfunction. Verify proper operation and calibration of each monitoring and protective device. Perform benchmark tests as recommended in Section 2.1.2.1.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.3

2.1.5.3.1 At a minimum, perform dissolved-gas-in-oil analysis 18 to 24 hours after energization, one month later, and six months later to determine if the transformer has any infant mortality problems.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.3.1

2.1.5.4 Do not overload the transformer. If short-term overloading is required for emergency purposes, perform studies to determine the economic, loss of life, and bubbling risks associated with overloading. Consider the use of a dynamic transformer monitoring and control system as described in Section 2.1.4.3, or a cooling system upgrade if frequent overloading of the transformer is expected.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.4

2.1.5.5 Do not reenergize transformers after the operation of protective devices until it has been determined that the transformer has not suffered internal damage and any external faults have been removed. At a minimum, investigate the operation of the protective device and perform a dissolved gas analysis (DGA) test to determine if the transformer has suffered internal damage. Additional testing may be needed depending on the results of the DGA test (see Section 2.1.2).\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.5

2.1.5.5.1 Exercise care when taking a DGA sample immediately following a fault. It may be prudent to wait several hours after the fault because fault gases may not have had enough time to migrate through the bulk of the oil. Taking a DGA sample too early can produce misleading results.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.5.1

2.1.5.5.2 Record the event and any subsequent tests results.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.5.2

2.1.5.6.1 Take the following precautions when insulating fluid is processed or replaced:\n\nA. Perform DGA and furan analysis before the insulating fluid is processed or replaced to preserve data about the transformerâs condition. Repeat DGA analysis immediately after the fluid has been processed or replaced. Perform both DGA and furan analysis about six months after the fluid has been processed or replaced.\n\nB. Take proper precautions when handling insulating fluid with high levels of combustible gas as this may present an explosion risk.\n\nC. Check replacement mineral oil for corrosive sulfur and PCB contamination.\n\nD. Ensure the equipment used to process the insulating fluid has been thoroughly cleaned to prevent PCB cross-contamination.\n\nE. Follow the manufacturerâs instructions regarding insulating fluid processing or replacement to prevent moisture contamination of the transformerâs solid insulation. For example, if the transformer has to be opened, most manufacturers limit this time to no more than 2 hours and recommend dry air be circulated into the transformer at a specified flow rate.\n\nF. Replace all fluid-immersed tank gaskets when insulating fluid is replaced, regardless of the type of oil.\n\nG. When ester-based fluid is used to replace mineral oil in power transformers with voltage class of 69 kV or higher, consult with the transformerâs OEM for a design review for fitness of use.\ntag: DS5-4 S2.1.5.6.1

3.0 SUPPORT FOR RECOMMENDATIONS\ntag: DS5-4 S3.0

3.1 Transformer Testing Diagnostics\n\nThe test limits discussed in this section are only general guidelines and should not be relied on to make important decisions. Better interpretation of test results can be obtained by comparing results from past tests, comparing test results with name plate information or with results from a family of similar equipment and observing trends.\n\nImproved interpretation can also be obtained by looking at results from other relevant tests; for example, oil screen results should be checked if power factor measurements on a transformer are unexpectedly high.\n\nComplementary tests should be performed to confirm a diagnosis. For example, frequency response analysis can be used to confirm if large changes in the capacitance measurement of a transformer is indicative of winding movement.\n\nDo not rely on any single test to make an important decision.\n\nThe reference temperature is ideally taken as the rated temperature for each component as provided by the manufacturer. However, this is not always readily available. It is also acceptable to use the temperature of neighboring equipment or neighboring points on the transformer as a reference. For example, when evaluating the bushings, a good reference temperature would be the coolest bushing. And, when evaluating the radiator banks, a good reference point would be the temperature of the top of the transformer tank.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1

3.1.1 Thermography\nThermography is performed with a thermographic camera with the transformer online. It can be used very effectively to detect the following problems:\n\nâ¢ Low fluid level in transformer or bushing\n\nâ¢ Blocked oil flow in radiators\n\nâ¢ Shut radiator banks\n\nâ¢ Eddy current heating of the tank\n\nâ¢ Overheating tap changer contacts\n\nâ¢ Loose connections at bushing terminals\n\nâ¢ Moisture contamination of surge arrestors\nGeneral criteria for evaluating thermographic scans is provided in Table 9.\n\nTable 9. General Criteria for Evaluating Thermographic Scans\n\n| Temperature Above Reference | Action |\n| --------------------------- | ------ |\n| 0Â°C to 10Â°C | Continue to monitor on regular basis. |\n| 10Â°C to 20Â°C | Repair at next convenient opportunity. |\n| 20Â°C to 40Â°C | Repair immediately. |\n| >40Â°C | Failure imminent; shut down equipment for repair. |\n\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.1 T9

3.1.2 Fluid Screen Testing\nFluid screen testing is performed to determine if the transformer insulating fluid is suitable for continued service. The tests listed in Table 10A are typically included in a mineral oil screen test. Their parameters and acceptance limits are also included. These limits are based on IEEE C57.106 and refer to service-aged insulating oil. Different limits apply to new oil.\n\nFor natural ester oil, see Table 10B for parameters and acceptance limits that are based on IEEE C57.147.\n\nTable 10A. Tests Typically Included in a Mineral Oil Screen Test\n\n[file:///table-5-4-10a.png]\n\n|     | Acceptance Limits | Based on Voltage Class |     |\n| --- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | --- |\n| Test | Less than 69 kV | 69kV to 230 kV | More than 230 kV |\n| Dielectric Strength ASTM D1816-97 | | | |\n| 1 mm gap | 23 kV min | 28 kV min | 30 kV min |\n| 2 mm gap | 40 kV min | 47 kV min | 50 kV min |\n| Power Factor ASTM D924-99e1 | | | |\n| 25C | 0.5% max | 0.5% max | 0.5% max |\n| 100C | 5.0% max | 5.0% max | 5.0% max |\n| Interfacial Tension ASTM D971-99a mN/m | 25 min | 30 min | 32 min |\n| Neutralization Number ASTM D974-02 Mg KOH/g | 0.2 max | 0.15 max | 0.10 max |\n| Water Content 50C | 27 mg/kg 15% sat | 12 mg/kg 8% sat | 10 mg/kg 5%sat |\n| 60C | 35 mg/kg 15% sat | 20 mg/kg 8% sat | 12 mg/kg 5% sat |\n| 70C | 55 mg/kg 15% sat | 30 mg/kg 8% sat | 15 mg/kg 5% sat |\n\nOxidation Inhibitor Content ASTM D2668-96 Type II oil | 0.09% min | 0.09% min | 0.09% min\n\nTable 10B.

At certain interfacial tension and acidity levels, the oil is prone to forming sludge that can coat the windings and lead to decreased cooling efficiency. In addition to increasing the oil-sludging tendency, acid is also a catalyst for cellulose aging and can accelerate the deterioration of the paper insulation.\n\nThe tests described in the following sections may also be performed on the oil to determine if incipient faults or deterioration are present in the transformer.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.2 T10A T10B

3.1.2.1 Furan Analysis\n\nFuranic compounds are generated when paper insulation in the transformer degrades. These compounds are concentrated in the paper, but will partition to the oil. Sampling the oil and testing for furanic compounds provides a convenient and nonintrusive means of determining the extent of degradation of the transformerâs paper insulation.\n\nThere are some important factors that need to be considered:\n\nA. Type of paper insulation. Transformers with thermally up-rated (KTU) paper will generate much less furan compounds. For this reason, furan analysis on transformers with KTU paper relies on the measurement of the total furan concentration rather than just the 2FAL (2-furfural) concentration.\n\nTransformers used in North America are almost all manufactured with KTU paper, while transformers in the rest of the world use non-thermally up-rated (NTU) paper.\n\nB. Filtering or replacement of transformer fluid. Filtering of transformer fluid or replacement of the fluid will remove the furan compounds from the oil. However, the furan compounds will repartition back into the oil from the paper and will reach equilibrium within six months. FM Global recommends the fluid be tested for furans before filtering or replacement and then again six months later to ensure valuable data is not lost.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.2.1

3.1.2.2 Particles in Oil\n\nThe measurement of metallic as well as non-metallic particles in oil allows problems such as oil pump wear, pump bearing deterioration, electrical arcing, and contamination to be detected.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.2.2

3.1.3 Dissolved Gas Analysis\n\nDissolved gas analysis is performed to determine if there are incipient faults in the transformer windings, core, and tap changer. By analyzing the concentration, ratios, and generation rates of key dissolved gases in the transformer oil, the type of fault, as well as its severity, can be determined. The key gases that are included in a typical DGA report and the most likely faults that generate these gases are listed in Table 11 (see Table 12 for names of gases represented by the chemical formulas).\n\nTable 11. Gases Included in a Typical DGA Report\n\n| Key Gas | Secondary Key Gas | Likely Cause |\n| ------- | ----------------- | ------------ |\n| COâ/CO | Hâ, CâHâ | Conductor overheating involving cellulose |\n| CâHâ | CHâ, Hâ, and CâHâ | Oil overheating |\n| Hâ |  CHâ, CâHâ, and CâHâ | Partial discharge |\n| CâHâ | Hâ, CHâ, and CâH  | Arcing |\n\nTable 12. Gases Represented by Chemical Formulas\n\n| Chemical Formula | Name |\n| ---------------- | ---- |\n| Hâ | Hydrogen |\n| CHâ | Methane |\n| CâHâ | Acetylene |\n| CâHâ | Ethylene |\n| CâHâ | Ethane |\n| CO | Carbon Monoxide |\n| COâ | Carbon Dioxide |\n| Oâ | Oxygen |\n| Nâ | Nitrogen |\n\nOther key gases sometimes included in DGA results are propane and propylene.\n\nThere are many factors that will affect the DGA results for a transformer. The interpretation of DGA results is a highly specialized field requiring an understanding of both oil and paper chemistry as well as transformer design, construction, and operation.\n\nFactors such as the oil preservation system (sealed, nitrogen blanketed, or free breathing) will influence the dissolved gas analysis results. Sealed transformers keep most of the fault gases within the oil. Free breathing transformers allow some fault gases to escape to atmosphere, while the dissolved gases in nitrogen blanketed transformers will partition between the oil and the gas blanket depending on the individual gas partial pressures. These transformers will all show different DGA patterns for the same fault.\n\nHaving the tap changer in a separate compartment or within the main tank will also have an effect on the DGA pattern. Tap changers generate gases at different rates depending on factors such as the diverter switch type, number of tap changer operations, and the tap changer design. Faults with the tap changer will also generate gases. These gases can mix with the oil in the main tank and may either mask faults in the main tank or lead to a wrong conclusion that there is a fault in the main tank.\n\nTable 14 lists the dissolved gas concentrations for assessment of a gassing condition on a mineral oil filled transformer with no previous history, e.g. a new or repaired transformer, as a reference. They are consensus values based on IEEE C57.104: IEEE guide for the interpretation of gases generated in oil-immersed transformers. Users may decide to use different dissolved gas concentrations for a transformer based on experience with other similar transformers. Condition 2, 3 and 4 indicates problem may exist and re-sample to establish the trend is needed for further investigation. Table 13 provides reference guidance for gas generation rate when there is no industrial reference or manufacturer guidance available. For silicon oil filled transformers, refer table 15. Table 16 is used for ester oil filled transformers.\n\nTable 13.

This is especially true if oil sampling is done by the transformer owner or a third party rather than a transformer oil testing laboratory. Improper oil sampling practices will render oil screen testing and dissolved gas analysis completely useless and, even worse, it can give misleading results that cause a bad decision to be made. For example, when taking oil samples for dissolved gas analysis, an oil sampling syringe should be used so dissolved gases are not lost to atmosphere. The syringe should also be protected from sunlight and extreme temperatures that can also cause the concentration of dissolved gases to change. Taking an oil sample for DGA from the same bottle that has been used to collect oil for oil screen tests will result in a DGA result that has higher concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen. The concentration of hydrogen and some of the other lighter gases will also be lower as these gases are lost when the oil sample is exposed to atmosphere.\n\nA proper flushing of the oil valve on the transformer is needed to ensure a good oil sample is collected. The body of the oil valve frequently collects debris, rust, and free water, which will result in misleading oil screen test results.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.3 T11 T12 T13 T14 T15 T16

3.1.4 Exciting Current\nPurpose: To detect shorted core laminations, poor core joints, short circuited or open circuited windings, poor electrical connections, tap changer problems, core and winding movement.\n\nThe exciting current test is performed by applying the same AC voltage to the high side windings. The voltage is applied to one winding at a time with all other windings open circuited. The exciting current (comprising the core magnetizing current, resistive loss current and capacitive charging current) drawn by the winding is measured. This test should be performed before any DC tests have been performed. DC testing leaves a residual magnetism of the core that will influence the exciting current.\n\nIt is good practice to repeat each exciting current measurement with the tap changer in neutral, raised one position and lowered one position, as well as at full raise and full lower positions. If the exciting current test is being used to diagnose problems with the tap changer, the test should be performed for all tap position.\n\nDoble Engineering has identified 12 different tap changer exciting current patterns.\n\nThe exciting current test is evaluated by looking at the pattern of the exciting current.\n\nFor three-phase, star-connected, core-form transformers, the exciting current pattern is two high similar currents corresponding to the two windings on the outer core limbs and a low current corresponding to the middle winding.\n\nFor three-phase, delta-connected, core-form transformers the exciting current pattern is two high but dissimilar currents corresponding to the two windings on the outer core limbs and a low current corresponding to the middle winding.\n\nIt is important to note that exciting current patterns can vary depending on transformer construction.\n\nIt is possible to use the difference between the two higher currents to detect problems. As a general rule, if the exciting current is greater than 50 mA, there should not be more than 5% difference between the magnitudes of the two higher currents. If the exciting current is less than 50 mA, there should not be more than 10% difference between the magnitudes of the two higher currents.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.4

3.1.5 Turns Ratio for On-Load Tap Changers\nPurpose: To detect shorted turns, open circuited windings, and tap changer problems.\n\nThe turns-ratio test is performed using a special test set. A known low voltage is applied to the primary winding and the induced voltage is measured on the secondary winding. In a three winding transformer, the induced voltage on the tertiary winding is also measured. The test is performed one phase at a time.\n\nThe measured turns-ratio should be within 0.5% of the nameplate value. Deviations between the measured and nameplate value can indicate shorted turns, open circuits, incorrect winding connections and tap changer problems. Usually further testing or visual internal inspection of the transformer or tap changer is needed to locate a fault identified by turns-ratio testing.\n\nIt is good practice to perform turns-ratio tests on each of the tap changer positions and compare these against the nameplate values to detect problems with the tap changer.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.5

3.1.6 Leakage Inductance\n\nPurpose: To detect core and winding movement, as well as windingdistortion.\n\nLeakage inductance (also referred to as âleakage reactanceâ or âshort circuit impedanceâ) is calculated by measuring the current drawn when a voltage is applied to the primary winding with the secondary winding shorted. This current is due to the transformer leakage flux and is used to calculate the transformerâs leakage inductance. This calculated value can be compared to the transformer nameplate. Difference between the nameplate leakage inductance and the calculated leakage inductance indicates winding deformation or winding movement.\n\nThe leakage inductance test is often performed using the power factor test set with the addition of another module.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.6

3.1.7 Power Factor and Capacitance\nPurpose: Power factor and capacitance measurement is used to determine the condition of the capacitive insulation between the windings, and between the windings and the core and tank. It can detect contamination of the winding insulation by moisture, carbon, and other material.\n\nThis test can also be applied to the bushings to determine the condition of condenser-type bushings. It can also detect contamination as well as deterioration of the capacitive layers in the bushing.\n\nThe test is performed by applying AC voltage to one set of windings with the test set in various modes. The current and watts from the other winding, as well as flowing to ground, are measured. The three different test set modes are:\n\nâ¢ GST-ground: where all currents are measured,\n\nâ¢ GST-guard: where only currents flowing to ground are measured, and\n\nâ¢ UST: where currents that flow to ground are not measured.\n\nDuring the test, all the terminals, including the neutrals, are connected together to remove any inductance effects, and the neutral is ungrounded. The tap changer is set in a position off neutral. Test voltage is applied to one set of windings with the test set in the three different modes. The test is then repeated by applying the test voltage to the other set of windings. This helps reveal errors in the testing procedure since the results obtained should be similar.\n\nThe power factor is calculated from the watts and current measurements. The power factor is equivalent to the dissipation factor, tan delta, or dielectric loss angle for the ranges of power factor that are of interested.\n\nThe test set also measures the capacitance for each test mode. Depending on the test mode, different capacitances are measured. These capacitances are:\n\nâ¢ CH: capacitance of the insulation between the high voltage winding and the grounded tank and core including the HV bushings,\n\nâ¢ CL: capacitance between the low voltage windings and the grounded tank and core including the LV bushings, and\n\nâ¢ CHL: capacitance between the high and low voltage windings.\n\nChanges in capacitance usually indicate changes in the geometry of the windings relative to each another or to the tank and core. Since the capacitance also includes components such as the tap changer, bushings, insulating fluid pressboard barriers, and structural elements, changes in the capacitance could also be influenced by changes in these components (e.g., insulating fluid contamination, bushing and tap changer faults).\n\nPower factor test results must always be corrected for temperature. General rules for interpreting power factor results are listed in Table 17. The power factor limits for transformers are listed in Table 18, changes in the current between tests that can also be used for interpretation are listed in Table 19, and power factor limits for dry-type transformers are listed in Table 20.\n\nTable 17. General Rules for Interpreting Power Factor Results\n\n| Power factor | Interpretation |\n| ------------ | -------------- |\n| <0.5% | Good |\n| Between 0.5% and 0.7% | Deteriorated |\n| Between 0.5% and 1.0 % with an increasing trend | Investigate |\n| >1.0% | Bad |\n\nTable 18. Power Factor Limits for Transformers\n\n| Size | New | Service Aged |\n| ---- | --- | ------------ |\n| <500 kVA | 1.0% | 2.0% |\n| >500 kVA | 0.5% | 1.0% |\n\nTable 19. Interpretation of the Changes in Current Between Tests\n\n| Change in Current | Interpretation |\n| ----------------- | -------------- |\n| <3% | Good |\n| 3-5% | Deteriorated |\n| 5-10% | Investigate |\n| >10% | Bad |\n\nTable 20. Power Factor Limits for Dry-Type Transformers\n\n| Power Factor | Non-Cast Resin | Cast Resin |\n| ------------ | -------------- | ---------- |\n| CHL | 2.0% | 1.0% |\n| CH | 3.0% | 3.0% |\n| CL | 4.0% | 2.0% |\n\nIt is important to note that, as with all general guidelines for test results, better interpretation can be obtained from trends and comparing test results to similar transformers or nameplate data. Other relevant test information should also be consulted and complementary tests performed to confirm a diagnosis.\n\nThe power factor test set can also be used to determine the condition of the transformer bushings. Condenser or capacitive bushings will have either a potential test tap or a power factor test tap to allow power factor and capacitance testing to be performed.\n\nThe GST-ground mode is used to measure the overall power factor and capacitance of the bushing. In this test mode all the terminals of the winding under test are short circuited and the other windings are grounded.\n\nThe high voltage lead is attached to the center conductor of the bushing and the bushing flange ground is connected to ground terminal of the test set. All currents flowing through the main capacitive insulation of the bushing, the upper porcelain, the lower porcelain, the sight class, and the liquid or compound filler in the bushing are being measured.\n\nThe UST test mode is used to measure the power factor and capacitance of the bushingâs main insulation (C1) only. The high voltage lead is attached to the center conductor of the bushing, the low voltage lead is connected to the test tap, and the bushing flange ground is connected to ground terminal of the test set and is guarded. Only currents flowing through the main capacitive insulation of the bushing are being measured.\n\nThe GST-guard mode is used to measure the power factor and capacitance of the test tap (C2). In this test the high voltage lead is connected to the test tap (it is important to make sure the applied test voltage is appropriated for the test tap so as not to damage the test tap insulation), the low voltage lead is connected to the center conductor of the bushing and guard, and the bushing flange ground is connected to the ground terminal. Only currents flowing through the test tap insulation, the ground flange, and the immediate area of the porcelain around the test tap, are measured.\n\nâ¢ Overall and C1 Power Factor:\nIn general, if the value doubles original nameplate value or more, the bushing is questionable and needs to be replaced or refurbished.\n\nâ¢ C2 Power Factor:\nShould closely match nameplate and in general be less than 1.0%.\n\nâ¢ Capacitance:\nShould match nameplate with changes of more than 10% being cause for concern.\n\nOtherwise the bushing is questionable, and needs to be replaced or refurbished.\n\nNon-condenser-type bushings (e.g., solid porcelain bushings, epoxy bushings, compound filled, oil-filled and gas-filled bushings) do not have a test tap. It is not possible to measure the power factor and capacitance for these bushings. A hot collar test can be performed on these bushings to measure the watts loss and current. Increase of the watts loss is an indication of contamination of the outer surface of the bushing (typical Watts loss is between 0.02 and 0.04 Watts, with a Watts loss greater than 0.1 Watts being a cause for concern). Decrease of the current is an indication of internal voids, low oil or compound levels (typical currents of 40 to 120 mA).\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.7 T17 T18 T19 T20

3.1.8 Frequency Response Analysis\n\nPurpose: This test detects movement of the windings, core, and leads.\n\nThis test measures the frequency response of the transformer to either a variable frequency sinusoidal voltage input (frequency response method) or to an impulse voltage input (impulse response method). In both cases, the voltage is very low and the test is nondestructive.\n\nThe test protocol is as follows:\n\nFor each winding, inject the signal at one end of the winding and measure the response at the other end of the same winding. For star connected windings, inject the signal at one end of the winding and measure the response at the neutral.\n\nInject the signal into the high voltage winding and measure the response at the low voltage winding for each phase.\n\nFor windings with tap changers, perform the test with the tap changer in 2 positions: the neutral position and the position that puts the entire winding in the circuit.\n\nThe response (or transfer function) is displayed as a Bode Plot (amplitude vs. frequency) from power frequency to 2 MHz.\n\nThe shape of the frequency response is analyzed. In particular, the resonances of the frequency response curve provide information about the mechanical disposition of the transformer windings, leads, and core. This test is sensitive to very small changes in transformer winding, lead, and core geometry and can pick up problems such as axial winding collapse, hoop buckling, movement of windings relative to each another, and shorted turns.\n\nTo gain the most value from frequency response analysis, it is useful to have a previous frequency response plot to compare the readings to. However, the skill of knowledgeable experts as well as the experience in frequency response analysis has advanced to the stage where it is possible to obtain good information from a standalone test by comparing this against a database of expected results.\n\nThis test does require a knowledgeable person to interpret the results. Some companies are developing expert systems to perform this analysis as well as general rules for reading the results. This will enable less knowledgeable persons to provide a preliminary diagnosis. This is particularly valuable if FRA testing is used to determine if a transformer should be reenergized after seeing a fault.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.8

3.1.9 Insulation Resistance\n\nPurpose: This test is performed by applying a DC voltage and measuring the leakage current to determine if the transformer insulation is dry and clean. The test can also pick up any unintentional grounds.\n\nA mega-ohmmeter (Megger R) is typically used. The test is performed by shorting all the windings and making sure the tank and core are grounded. The resistance to ground is then measured from the primary windings to the secondary windings, and then from the secondary windings to the primary windings, as well as from each winding to ground. In a three winding transformer, the tertiary winding is also measured.\n\nThe resistance is a function of temperature (winding temperature, oil temperature, and ambient temperature).\n\nThe resistance is also a function of the physical size of the transformer and its construction. Therefore, in order to evaluate insulation resistance readings, the measured 60-second resistance value should be corrected to 20C and compared to a minimum resistance value derived from the following formula:\n\nR minimum = (0.8 x E) / â(kVA)\n\nWhere:\n\nE is the voltage rating of the winding under test.\n\nkVA is the rating of the transformer.\n\n0.8 is a factor used for oil filled transformers at 20Â°C. A factor of 16 should be used when windings are untanked.\n\nBecause of the temperature dependence of resistance measurement, dielectric absorption ratios are used to evaluate insulation cleanliness and dryness. The dielectric absorption ratio is the ratio of the 60-second insulation reading to the fifteen second insulation reading. A dielectric absorption ratio in the range of 1.3 to 3 indicates a clean and dry transformer.\n\nAnother insulation ratio used is the polarization index, which is a ratio of the 10-minute insulation reading to the 60-second insulation reading. A polarization index less than 1 indicates a wet or contaminated insulation. A polarization index greater than 2 indicates dry and clean insulation.\n\nIt is important to discharge the windings after an insulation resistance test because any residual charge will interfere with other electrical tests and generate bad results. There is also a potential for insulation resistance testing to magnetize the core and this can also result in bad test results. For these reasons it is good practice to make insulation resistance testing the last test performed on the transformer.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.9

3.1.10 Winding Resistance\nPurpose: This detects shorted turns, poor connections, open circuited windings and problems with the tap changer connections.\n\nWinding resistance is measured using a low resistance ohmmeter (Ductor R). The test is performed by measuring the phase to neutral winding resistance in a wye connected winding and the phase to phase winding resistance in a delta connected winding. The phase to phase winding resistance should be resolved to individual phase winding resistances.\n\nBecause winding resistance is temperature dependent, the followingprecautions must be taken:\n\nA. The current used to perform the measurement should not exceed 10% of the rated winding current.\n\nB. The transformer top and bottom oil temperature differential should be no more than 5Â°C.\n\nC. The winding temperature should be close to the average oil temperature. (Leaving a transformer deenergized for at least 3 hours is normally enough to meet the temperature requirements.) The measured winding resistance should be corrected to the same temperature at which the nameplate winding resistance has been provided, and then corrected in accordance to the following formula:\n\nR corrected = (R measured x (CF + CT)) / (CF + winding temperature)\n\nWhere\n\nCF = 234.5 for copper windings and 225 for aluminium windings.\n\nCT = 75 for 55Â°C rise transformers and 85 for 65Â°C rise transformers.\n\nWinding temperature is given in C.\n\nThere should not be more than 2% difference between the corrected measured value and the nameplate value. Differences more than 2% indicate short circuits, tap changer contact problems, or turn to turn shorts.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.10

3.1.11 Core Insulation Resistance\n\nThe transformer core is typically insulated from ground with only one deliberate core ground. Multiple core grounds lead to circulating currents in the core laminations and overheating of the core.\n\nThe core ground may be brought through the tank wall via a low voltage bushing or accessed by opening a man hole.\n\nCore insulation resistance testing performed on accessible core grounds can provide indication of multiple core grounds. The test is performed using a standard DC insulation resistance tester at no more than 1 kV.\n\nNew transformers have core ground resistances greater than 1000 Mohm. Service aged transformers have core ground resistances greater than 100 Mohm. Core ground resistances less than 10 Mohm should be investigated.\n\nDGA results can be used to check if core overheating is occurring. The presence of hot metal gases (ethane, ethylene and methane) is an indicator that core overheating may be occurring. CO and CO may also be present if the core overheating involves pressboard or paper insulation.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.11

3.1.12 Electromagnetic Interference Measurement\n\nPurpose: This test detects problems with the windings, core, and bushings that generate electrical noise.\n\nElectromagnetic interference measurement detects radio frequency noise using radio frequency antennae or high frequency current transformers. It is possible to apply triangulation or other methods to localize the source of radio frequency noise generated by the transformer. This test is relatively new and is often used as a complement to partial discharge measurements.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.12

3.1.13 Partial Discharge Measurement\n\nPurpose: This test detects problems with the windings, core and bushings that generate electrical noise.\n\nPartial discharge measurement may be performed using a variety of acoustic, electrical and radio frequency sensors. This test is relatively new but it is becoming more common as a factory acceptance test as well as a benchmarking test. It is also being performed more frequently as a condition monitoring or diagnostic test. Methods to triangulate the partial discharge activity have been developed that provide additional information as to the source and therefore the seriousness of the problem.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.13

3.1.14 Power Factor Tip-Up\n\nPurpose: This test detects contamination and other defects in the winding insulation.\n\nThis is the same test as conventional power factor testing; however, multiple measurements are taken as the test voltage is increased in steps.\n\nIncreasing power factor with increasing voltage is evidence of ionic contamination (i.e., conductive contaminants like rust, salts, and copper particles) or carbonization of the oil and/or winding. Polar contaminants such as moisture will not cause the power factor to increase with voltage.\n\nThe power factor tip up test, when applied to dry-type transformers, is useful in detecting ionic contamination and voids in the insulation. These will cause the power factor to increase with increasing voltage.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.14

3.1.15 Dielectric Frequency Response\n\nPurpose: This test is used to measure the amount of moisture in the solid insulation.\n\nDielectric frequency response is an extension of the power factor test. While the power factor test is performed at a single frequency (power frequency), the dielectric frequency response test measures the power factor of the transformer across a frequency range from 0.001 Hz to 1.0 kHz. This allows the determination of the cause of a poor power factor reading.\n\nThis test in particular allows engineers to distinguish between moisture in cellulose insulation, chemical contamination of cellulose insulation, and contamination of the oil or moisture in the oil as possible causes of a poor power factor reading. Knowing the cause of a poor power factor reading allows the problem to be treated more effectively.\n\nThe dielectric frequency response test is also able to provide an estimate of the moisture concentration in the cellulose insulation. This is useful in determining the aging rate and remaining life of the transformer as well as its susceptibility to bubbling.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.1.15

3.2 Online Condition Monitoring\n\nThe main advantage of continuous online monitoring comparing with routine testing is to allow for early detection in case of faults, monitor a transformer condition at emergency or the progress of deficiency conditions, and enables users to assess the hazards remotely. Therefore, online monitoring should be viewed as âwarningâ tools. Same level of attention and follow up action should be provided when online monitoring data indicate a potential problem evolving on the transformers as with results coming from routine laboratory or off-line testing.\n\nThere are many commercial condition monitoring products available, and this market is constantly evolving, with new products continually being offered to the transformer owner.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2

3.2.1 Gas-in-Oil Monitor System\n\nGas-in-oil online monitor system have been available for many years starting with hydrogen sensors. It is one of the best detectors of abnormalities in power transformers. Today, multiple-gas monitors are available that can detect all the important fault gasses individually. The following are main categories of the monitoring system per gas monitored:\n\nA. Single gas or composite gas monitors: these sensors detect hydrogen primarily. One example of such a monitor is to detect 100% of hydrogen concentration, 18% of carbon monoxide concentration, 8% of the acetylene concentration, and 1.5% of the ethylene concentration. Another example is to monitor 100% of dissolved hydrogen. These monitoring systems give a single readout in respond to abnormal operation of transformers and provide warning signal once the pre-set threshold value is exceeded. It is a relatively economical system.\n\nB. Multi-gas monitors: these systems can monitor up to eight or nine dissolved gasses individually. There are main two technologies used: gas-chromatography system or photo-acoustic spectroscopy. These systems provide a lot more information about the condition of transformers. They significantly increase the usefulness of the monitoring system for real time diagnostics on transformers.\n\nInstallation of dissolved gas monitors on existing transformers requires connection oil valves that are pre-existing.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2.1

3.2.2 Moisture in Oil Monitoring System\n\nThe commonly used moisture-in-oil sensors are based on thin-film capacitive element technology. The capacitance measured changes proportionally to the change in the relative saturation (relative humidity) of the moisture in the oil as those sensors respond to the change in relative humidity in the air. The instruments can provide indicate or relative saturation of moisture in oil or converted PPM performed using a built-in formula.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2.2

3.2.3 Condenser Bushing Insulation Monitoring System\n\nThere are different ways to monitor bushing insulation:\n\nA. Sum current monitoring system: The principle of the sum current method is based on the fact the initial sum of the leakage current from the testing tap of the three bushing should be theoretically zero when three bushings are identical. Any change in the sum current from the initial sum value would indicate a deterioration of the insulation of one or more of bushings.\n\nB. Relative power factor monitoring systems: They measure the power factor in a similar principle as the off-line power factor measurement. The main difference is the measurement circuit of an online systems uses the voltage of another phase as the reference.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2.3

3.2.4 Partial Discharge Monitoring\n\nPartial discharge activity monitoring systems are either electrical or acoustic based in general. They are only applicable for transformer with highest voltage rating above 4 kV. Either method has its own their own advantages and disadvantages and can be complimentary rather than exclusive Electrical method uses sensors are installed on bushing testing tap to measure electrical signal from PD activities. In such case, bushings act like capacitors and so electrical PD signal is induced through capacitance coupling. Alternatively, using split-core radio frequency current transformer (RFCT) or Rogowski around neutral connection, main tank ground, HV cable at the cable box or on the neutral strap of such cable, or ultrahigh frequency valve antenna.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2.4

3.2.4.1 Acoustic Monitoring\n\nThese monitoring systems are to detect acoustic wave in the range between 20kHz and 1 MHz propagated from partial discharge sources within the transformer tank. They can identify and locate PD sources with multiple sensors temporarily installed on transformer tanks externally.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2.4.1

3.2.5 Load Tap Changer Motor Current Monitoring\n\nThe use of online tap changers monitors has been successful to determine when mechanical problem with the mechanism are occurring. Motor current is to determine if any abnormal binding is occurring. This binding is usually indicative of a serious problem or impending failure of the tap change mechanism. However, the user must exercise caution when using this the method as the monitoring device must have the necessary measurement speed to correctly capture the motor current signature.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.2.5

3.3 FM Approved Transformers\n\nFM Approval is intended for liquid-filled transformers are either naturally cooled or utilizing forcibly circulated cooling medium. The standard limits Approval for the naturally cooled transformers rated from 5 to 10,000 kVA. If a transformer is FM Approved per Approval Standard 3990, fire frequency is considered reduced sufficiently that fire protection is not necessary. The FM Approval program considers the transformer as a system that includes evaluation of the fire properties of the liquid, the ability of the tank and transformer components to withstand the pressure generated by a low-level electrical fault, and the ability of electrical protection to clear a fault before tank rupture. The conditions of FM Approval are as follows:\n\nA. Tank design strength to prevent tank rupture under low energy fault conditions.\n\nB. A pressure relief device to relieve pressure if a low current fault occurs until the fault can be cleared by electrical protection described in Item 3 below.\n\nC. Electrical protection to clear sustained low current faults. This protection could be in the form of a ground fault relay and sudden pressure relay, or other devices of equivalent reliability.\n\nD. Electrical protection to clear high current faults. This protection is based on the kVA rating of the transformer and is intended to electrically isolate the transformer rapidly enough to prevent pressure increase to greater than half the tank burst pressure.\n\nE. Use of FM Approved transformer fluids.\n\nF. For FM Approved network transformers, secondary side electrical protection is needed in addition to the above. This protection could be in the form of ground fault detection or other technology of demonstrated equivalence. This device should trip the high-side disconnect devices of the transformer experiencing the fault and other paralleled transformers in the network.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.3

3.4 Transformer Aging\n\nThe following discussion is based on rules of thumb and should only be used as a guide to qualitatively determine how different factors affect loss of transformer life. Knowledgeable experts should be used to accurately determine the remaining life of transformers.\n\nTransformer age is determined by the tensile strength of its paper insulation. The tensile strength will decrease as the paper insulation degrades. When the paper insulation loses most of its tensile strength, it is no longer able to withstand the normal electrical stresses associated with everyday operation of the transformer.\n\nInsulation failure will occur.\n\nIn addition to normal operating electrical stress, the paper insulation also has to withstand mechanical and electrical stresses due to abnormal conditions such as overvoltages, electrical faults, and mechanical vibration. These stresses are typically higher than the normal operating stress.\n\nThe degradation of paper insulation in transformers depends on four mechanisms:\n\nâ¢ Pyrolysis (heat)\n\nâ¢ Hydrolysis (water)\n\nâ¢ Oxidation (air)\n\nâ¢ Acidity\n\nThese degradation mechanisms are interrelated. Heat will cause paper to degrade.  Degradation of paper will generate moisture. Moisture will contribute to the degradation of paper. The assessment of transformer life is a complex problem.\n\nThe following rules of thumb exist for the three degradation mechanisms:\n\nA. Every 7Â°C increase in temperature above the rated hot spot temperature will double paper insulation aging rate.\n\nB. Every doubling of the moisture content in the paper insulation above 0.5% by weight will double paper insulation aging rate.\n\nC. Transformers operating in a high oxygen environment will age in the order of 2.5 times faster than transformers operating in a low oxygen environment.\n\nBecause aging of transformers depends on these four factors, the nameplate age alone cannot be solely relied upon to determine when a transformer needs to be replaced.\n\nDegradation of paper causes the long cellulose chains to break. Shorter cellulose chains provide less tensile strength. The length of cellulose chains in paper is measured in degrees of polymerization (DP). New transformers have paper insulation with a DP of 800. The IEEE has set the transformer end-of-life criterion at a DP of 200, which represents a loss of 50% tensile strength.\n\nFM Global recommends the use of oil screen tests, DGA, and furan analysis as screening tools to indicate when transformers are approaching their end of life. Oil screen tests will identify transformers with high moisture in paper concentrations. The ratios and concentrations of CO and COâ in DGA analysis will identify transformers where thermal degradation of the paper is a serious concern. And, furan analysis will provide an approximation of the DP of the paper insulation.\ntag: DS5-4 S3.4

Network transformer:\nThese transformers are located in vaults in buildings or adjacent to buildings. The vaults contain two or more power transformers. These transformers are supplied from different transmission or distribution lines and are paralleled on their low voltage side through circuit interrupting devices called ânetwork protectorsâ. Typically, high voltage current interrupting devices have not been used in the network vault. The low-voltage bus of a network vault may be electrically tied to a number of other vaults to form a network secondary distribution system, called a low-voltage network grid.\ntag: DS5-4 GLOSSARY

May 2006.\n\nNew definitions were added to Appendix A, Glossary of Terms.\ntag: DS5-4 REVISION

May 2005.\n\nEditorial changes were done to the recommendation 2.3.1.2.1.1.\ntag: DS5-4 REVISION

January 2005.\n\nThe following changes were done for this revision:\n\n1. Section 2.2 Indoor Transformers, recommendations 2.2.1.2.2 & 2.2.1.3.2.2. A protection alternate to CO-2 of an FM Approved gaseous agent protection system or a water mist system FM Approved for machinery spaces is recommended. Also, where automatic sprinkler protection is used, the density has been increased to 0.3 gpm/ft (15 mm/min) from 0.2 gpm/ft (10 mm/min).\n\n2. Section 2.3 Oâutdoor Transformer, recommendation 2.3.1.2.3 for open pit containment system. Where automatic sprinkler protection is used, the sprinkler density has been increased to 0.3 gpm/ft (15 mm/min) from 0.15 gpm/ftÂ²(6 mm/min). Where a flame arrestor is used to increase the amount of time before burning oil enters the pit Size No 5 rather than Size No 2 ASTM D448 Standard Classification for Sizes of Aggregate for Road and Bridge Construction should be used. Size No 5 is closer to the 1.5 in (3.8 cm) washed and uniformly sized rock tested at the FM Global Research Campus.\n\n3. Section 3.1.1, Approved and Equivalent Transformer. A transformer equivalent to an FM Approved transformer is defined as a transformer with a UL listing per NEC Section 450-23 with electrical protection to clear sustained low current faults. The reference to NEC 450-23 was left out of the previous edition.\n\nTransformers complying with NEC 450-23 include four of the five safeguards requested for an FM Approved transformer. Low current fault protection is the remaining safeguard.\ntag: DS5-4 REVISION

May 2003.\n\nThe following changes were done for this revision:\n\n1. Tables 2a and 2b Separation Distances. The change allows medium sized transformers containing FM Approved less flammable fluids to be located as close to buildings and to other transformers as small transformers were in the previous standard. This provided there is adequate space for inspection and maintenance. Medium sized transformers may contain up to 10,000 gal (37.9 mÂ³) of fluid.\n\n2. Section 2.3.1.2 Containment. The change increases the quantity of FM Approved less flammable fluid in a transformer before a containment system is recommended. It increases the size of the transformer to 1320 gal (5 mÂ³) for transformers containing all FM Approved less flammable fluids. It further increases the size to 2640 gal (10 mÂ³) if the fluid is certified as biodegradable and if a release does not expose navigable waterways. A definition is included for navigable waterways. The fluid would have to be certified as biodegradable by the responsible governmental authority.\n\n3. Minor editorial changes were made to Section 2.3.1.2.1.4.\ntag: DS5-4 REVISION
